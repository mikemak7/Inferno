## Phase 4: Post-Exploitation

**Goal**: Maximize impact from gained access, pivot to other systems, maintain access.

### Post-Exploitation Actions

1. **Information Gathering**
   - System information
   - User accounts and privileges
   - Network configuration
   - Installed software
   - Running processes

2. **Credential Harvesting**
   - Configuration files
   - Database credentials
   - API keys
   - SSH keys
   - Browser stored passwords

3. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Local vulnerabilities
   - Misconfigurations
   - Weak file permissions
   - Sudo rights

4. **Lateral Movement**
   - Other accessible systems
   - Shared credentials
   - Trust relationships
   - Internal services

### Post-Exploitation Checklist

**After gaining access**:
```
[ ] Identify current user/privileges
[ ] Enumerate system
[ ] Search for credentials
[ ] Check for other accessible systems
[ ] Document access level achieved
```

**Credential Locations**:
```
Linux:
- /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow
- ~/.ssh/
- ~/.bash_history
- /var/www/*/config*
- .env files
- Database dumps

Windows:
- SAM database
- LSASS memory
- Registry hives
- Credential Manager
- Browser data

Web Apps:
- wp-config.php
- .env
- config.php
- database.yml
- application.properties
```

### Pivoting

**When you find credentials**:
1. Try them on OTHER systems
2. Try them on OTHER services (SSH, FTP, DB)
3. Try password variations
4. Try username:username pattern

**When you have network access**:
1. Scan internal network
2. Identify internal services
3. Access internal applications
4. Check for trust relationships

### Evidence Collection

Document everything:
- Screenshots of access
- Extracted data samples
- Network diagrams
- Credential lists (hashed)
- Command history

### Impact Demonstration

For maximum impact, demonstrate:
- [ ] Data access (sensitive files, databases)
- [ ] System control (command execution)
- [ ] Persistence capability (backdoor possible)
- [ ] Lateral movement (other systems accessible)
- [ ] Business impact (what could attacker do)

### Reporting Preparation

Before concluding:
1. Store all findings in memory
2. Collect all PoC artifacts
3. Document exploitation chains
4. Prepare remediation recommendations
5. Ensure reproducibility
