## Phase 3: Exploitation

**Goal**: Prove vulnerabilities with working exploits and demonstrated impact.

### Exploitation Priorities

1. **Known CVEs** (if found via NVD lookup)
   - Check exploit references
   - Adapt public exploits to target
   - Document version match

2. **Authentication Bypass**
   - Default credentials
   - SQLi in login
   - JWT manipulation
   - Session fixation

3. **Injection Attacks**
   - SQL Injection → Data extraction
   - Command Injection → RCE
   - SSTI → RCE
   - XSS → Session hijacking

4. **Access Control**
   - IDOR → Access other users' data
   - Privilege escalation → Admin access
   - Path traversal → File read

### Exploitation Workflow

```
1. SELECT target vector (highest confidence first)
        ↓
2. CRAFT minimal PoC
        ↓
3. TEST and observe response
        ↓
4. VALIDATE: Did it work?
   - YES → Escalate impact, document, store finding
   - NO → Analyze why, adjust, or pivot
        ↓
5. ESCALATE: What else can I do with this?
   - Extract more data
   - Pivot to other systems
   - Chain with other findings
```

### Attack Patterns by Vulnerability

**SQL Injection**:
```
1. Confirm: ' OR '1'='1 (auth bypass)
2. Identify DB: Version extraction
3. Enumerate: Database, tables, columns
4. Extract: Credentials, sensitive data
5. Escalate: File read (LOAD_FILE), file write (INTO OUTFILE)
```

**XSS**:
```
1. Confirm: <script>alert(1)</script>
2. Bypass filters if blocked
3. Craft session stealer
4. Demonstrate cookie theft
5. Escalate: Account takeover PoC
```

**SSRF**:
```
1. Confirm: Internal resource access
2. Hit cloud metadata: 169.254.169.254
3. Extract: AWS keys, instance role
4. Escalate: Access S3, EC2, other services
```

**Command Injection**:
```
1. Confirm: ; id or | whoami
2. Enumerate: System info, users
3. Escalate: Reverse shell or direct command
4. Persist: Add user, install backdoor
```

### Proof of Concept Requirements

Every finding MUST include:
- **Command/Request**: Exact payload used
- **Response/Output**: Actual result
- **Impact**: What this proves
- **Reproducibility**: Steps to recreate

### False Positive Prevention

**Observations ≠ Vulnerabilities** until behavior proven:

| Observation | Required Proof |
|-------------|----------------|
| API key in JS | Demonstrate privilege abuse |
| CORS: * header | Cross-origin data read with PoC |
| Version disclosure | Actual CVE exploitation |
| SSL issues | Intercepted sensitive data |
| Directory listing | Sensitive file access |

### Gate Check

Before moving to post-exploitation:
- [ ] Vulnerabilities proven with PoC
- [ ] Impact demonstrated (not theoretical)
- [ ] Findings stored in memory
- [ ] All exploited vulns documented

**Question**: "Have I achieved the objective or maximized impact?"
- NO → Continue exploitation, try chains
- YES → Move to Phase 4: Post-Exploitation or Report
