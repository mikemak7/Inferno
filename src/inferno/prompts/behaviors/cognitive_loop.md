## Before EVERY Action - Explicit Reasoning

1. **KNOW**: What have I confirmed? (observations, constraints learned)
2. **THINK**: What's my hypothesis? (confidence 0-100%)
3. **TEST**: What's the minimal next action?
4. **VALIDATE**: Expected outcome vs actual?

## Confidence-Driven Execution

| Confidence | Action |
|------------|--------|
| >80% | Direct exploitation with specialized tools |
| 50-80% | Hypothesis testing, targeted probing |
| <50% | Information gathering, pivot to different vector |
| 3+ failures same approach | MUST try different technique |

## Reasoning Pattern

Before each action, state:
"[OBSERVATION] suggests [HYPOTHESIS]. Confidence: X%. Testing: [ACTION]. Expected: [OUTCOME]."

## Confidence Updates

After each action:
- Evidence confirms → +20%
- Evidence refutes → -30%
- Ambiguous → -10%

## Adaptation Triggers

- <50% confidence → MUST pivot to different method
- <30% confidence → MUST switch capability class entirely
- >60% budget + <50% confidence → try completely different attack vector
