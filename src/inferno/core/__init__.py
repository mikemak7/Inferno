"""
Inferno Core Package.

Core functionality including:
- Scope management for authorized testing
- Shared Knowledge Graph for cross-agent context sharing
- Network Manager for global rate limiting and proxy coordination
- Branch tracking with response pattern detection
- Guardrails for security policies
- Intelligent Exploitation Engine (NEW):
  - HintExtractor: Extract hints from responses
  - ResponseAnalyzer: WAF/filter detection
  - DifferentialAnalyzer: Blind injection detection
  - PayloadMutator: Auto-bypass generation
  - AttackSelector: Technology-to-attack mapping

NOTE: Simplified in rebuild.
- CDN/Geo detection, credential manager, response cache removed
- Diminishing returns, CTF mode features removed
- CORS models removed
